# Claire Sturgill projects

I'm using this repo to store projects I've worked on, code for learning new technologies and other code efforts. I'm trying to keep it organized so it's useful to me
and might also be meaningful to potential employers. It's organized into the following sections:

## web

This is for small web programming projects and supporting code for exploring new web technologies.

## competitive-programming

This is for different competitive programming sites and contests. It should contain a subdirectory for each little programming problem I've solved.
